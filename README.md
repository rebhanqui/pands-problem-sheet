A collection of Weekly Tasks set in the PANDS Module

## List of Contents

1. Hello World [^2]

`print("helloworld")`

`# is this thing on?`

>Prints the text *hellowworld* when called in terminal via - `python helloworld.py`

---

2. Accounts

>Program that reads in 10 digits and outputs same digits with only last 4 showing and first 6 replaced with X's


`account_raw = input("Please enter your 10 digit account number: ")`
>Takes in the users account number

```python
account_secure = (f"Account number: XXXXXX{account_raw[-4:]}")
print(account_secure)
```

>Confirms last 4 digits of account while hiding the first 6 digits via index and prints the result
---

3. Bank

Prompts user to input 2 amounts in cents, adds both and prints output to user in Euros and Cents readable amount

>Input 1 and 2 take in a number and change it to a int to then be added and assigned to the totalLodgement var

```python
bankIn = int(input("Lodgement Amount 1 (in cents): "))
bankIn2= int(input("Lodgement Amount 2 (in cents): "))

totalLodgement = (bankIn + bankIn2)
```

>Converts input to euros first without reamining cents using int division

```python
eurosAmount = (totalLodgement//100)
```

>The remainder operator yields the last two digits using % 100 and prints the cents after euros taken [^3]

```python
centsAmount = (totalLodgement % 100)
```

>Prints the total amount

```python
print(f"You have lodged â‚¬{eurosAmount}.{centsAmount}\nThank You!")
```

4. Collatz


`def collatz(number):`
>Creates function to run following collatz sequence [^5] 

`if (number % 2 == 0):`
    `return number // 2`
>Takes positive int and divides by two until odd number 


```python
elif (number % 2 == 1):
    return number * 3 + 1
else :
    print("ERROR")
    return None
```

>When encountering an odd number then program multiplies by 3 and adds 1 

```python
print("Enter a number. ")
number = int(input())
print(number)
```

>User input of int 

```python
while (number != 1):
   number = collatz(number)
   print(number)
print(number)
```

>Ends when result gets to 1

---

5. Weekday

>Prints one of two results depend if it is a weekday or not.

```python
print("Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday")
print("It is the weekend, yay!")
```

By using import date the code can tell what the current day is without import. [^6]

```python
import datetime
```

By giving the function perameters, if its not monday Friday (0-5) then it is the weekend

```python
while datetime == range(0, 5):
```

---

6. Squareroot [^7]

```python
numbers = int(input("Please pick a number: "))
```

A function to find the square root of any number input by user
>The function below applies the newton method of getting the square root

```python
def newtonSqrt(numbers): 
    approx = 0.5 * numbers
    better = 0.5 * (approx + numbers/approx)
    
    while better != approx:
        approx = better
    better = 0.5 * (approx + numbers/approx)

    return approx
```

>The numbers variable is the parameter to facilitate the square root calculation
While function allows the input eventually be multiplied by .5 to be further calculated to get the square root

---

7. Read E's

Creates a permanent file path

```python
FILENAME = "/Users/rebeccaquinn/Desktop/pands-problem-sheet/countfile.txt"
```

Opens file and reads it with 'r'

```python
file = open(FILENAME, 'r')
```

Puts file content to string

```python
data = file.read()
```

Requests user input to select a letter

```python
letter = input("Pick a letter to see how many occurences are in the count file: ")
```

The `.count` counts how many times the chosen letter occurs and then prints the result [^8] [^9]

```python
occurences = data.count(letter)

print(f"There are {occurences} letter {letter}'s in the count file")
```

---

8. Plottask

Imports python packages to assist in plotting various charts and historgrams

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Distributuon is normal at 1000, mean is 5 and standard deviation is 2 for this historgram

```python
meanvalue = 5
standard = 2
distrib = 1000
x = np.random.normal(meanvalue, standard, distrib)
```

Arranging the histogram [^10]

```python
xpoints = np.arange(0,11)

#x (xpoints) to the power of 3 using pow 
ypoints = pow(xpoints, 3,)
```

Styling the plot and historgram details [^11]

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14,7)) # size of fig 14x7
plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid') #grid style
plt.title("Plotting Plot")
```

Labels and further styling [^12] [^13]

```python
plt.hist(x, facecolor="cyan", edgecolor="white", label="X Data") # draw solid white grid lines
plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints, linewidth=5.0, color="pink", label="Y Data") 
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=2.)
```

The commented out code saves the file and the end prints to screen without saving the result [^14]

```python
#plt.savefig("plottask.png")

plt.show()
```
