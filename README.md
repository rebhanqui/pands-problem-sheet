#add both int numbers
totalLodgement = (bankIn + bankIn2)

# converts input to euro and cents with the decimal point
# ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46189874/python-find-the-dollar-and-cent USR: YOHAN DE ROSE
euroCents = (totalLodgement/100)

#euro and cent amount output to user with trailing zero kept so cent amounts with '0' in them stay visible
# '%.2f' ref5: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15238120/keep-trailing-zeroes-in-python USR: eyquem
